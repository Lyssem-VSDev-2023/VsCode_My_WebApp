- **`React`** uses a special syntax known as **JavaScript XML (JSX)**. **`JSX`** allows you to integrate **both** **`HTML`** (or custom components you might create) and **`JavaScript`** into a **single** file or even single line of code.

- By using **`JSX`**, you can rely on **`JavaScript`** syntax for **logic**. Visual Studio Code provides **IntelliSense** for `JSX files`, so it's a useful tool when you're working with React.

- **`JSX`** relies on **Extensible Markup Language (XML)**. XML's syntax is similar to HTML. In many instances you might not notice a difference. However, XML places a couple of important restrictions on your syntax:

  - All elements must be placed **inside one parent element**.
  - All elements must be **closed**.

## The build process <a id="the-build-process" />

[&#9650;](#introduction-to-react)

- Browsers **don't natively** support JSX. So `JavaScript` and `HTML` must be **generated from the JSX** files to be rendered by a browser. Several **`bundlers`** and other tools can perform the necessary tasks. These tools include `Webpack`, `Parcel`, and `Snowpack`. We'll use **`Snowpack`** because it doesn't require code or extra scripting.

## Components <a id="components" />

[&#9650;](#introduction-to-react)

- **React development** is based on **`components`**. **`Components`** are **self-contained** units of both **display** and **work**. They can be reused in your application. Use them to logically break down your application into **smaller chunks** (or components).

## React Project Structure <a id="react-project-structure" />

[&#9650;](#introduction-to-react)

Let's explore the folders and files in the starter project:

- **`package.json`** contains the list of packages and scripts:
  - **Packages**:
    - **`React`** for React
    - **`ReactDOM`** to mount our application inside the browser
  - **Scripts**:
    - **`start`** to run the development server from Snowpack:
      - It **virtually builds** all `JavaScript` and `HTML` files.
      - It **hosts** and **automatically restarts** the server as files are **changed**.
    - **`build`** to generate **production files** for deployment
- **`public`** contains all **static files**.
- **`src`** contains all **React files**.
- **`snowpack.config.js`** contains the core configuration for Snowpack.
  - **`mount`** creates two virtual directories for our Snowpack server.
    - **`public`** contains all **static files** (such as `HTML`, CSS``, and `images`). It's hosted as **`/`\*\*.
    - **`src`** contains all `JSX files` and associated `React` files. It's hosted as **`dist`**.

## Create the application host <a id="create-the-application-host" />

[&#9650;](#introduction-to-react)

Under the **`public`** Folder, create an `index.html` file with the following code:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Recipes</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/dist/index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Notice two important lines in our HTML:

- `<div id="app"></div>`: This line **creates** the HTML element that **hosts** our `React` application. We **call** this element by its **`ID`** to **render** our application.
- `<script type="module" src="/dist/index.js"></script>`: This line loads the **JavaScript**.

**`Note:`**

- The name of the file we're importing is `index.js`. We **don't use** `index.jsx`, because browsers **can't render** `JSX` files. We always need a bundler (such as `Snowpack`) to generate `JavaScript`. We reference the `JavaScript` rather than the `JSX`.

- The **`type="module"`** attribute allows us to use `import` statements in our `JavaScript` (or `JSX`) files. This functionality is relatively new to browsers. It helps us `import` the necessary `packages` and `components`.

## Create the entry point to the React application <a id="create-the-entry-point-to-the-react-application" />

[&#9650;](#introduction-to-react)

Under the **`src`** Folder, create an `index.jsx` file with the following code:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>, document.getElementById("app"));
```

Our **`index.jsx`** file starts by **importing** two important **libraries**:

- The `first` library, **`React`**, allows us to use **`JSX`**. It will be **imported** in **every** `component` or `JSX` file we create.
- The `second` library, **`ReactDOM`**, **renders** our application inside the `HTML`.

**`render`** takes two parameters:

- The `HTML` we want to display. **In this case**, the `HTML` is an **`h1`** heading
- We'll use the `element` that has an **`ID`** of **`app`** to **display** our `HTML`.

## Start the React Application <a id="start-the-react-application" />

[&#9650;](#introduction-to-react)

- open an Intergarted terminal and execute:

```text
npm start
```

- Your default browser should automatically **open** and **display** your page.

- If the page doesn't appear automatically, open your browser and go to

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

- Our `JSX` code is converted into the appropriate `HTML` and `JavaScript` for display in the browser.
- Open the **JavaScript** file generated by **`Snowpack`**:

```text
http://localhost:8080/dist/index.js
```

- You'll see the following code:

```js
import React from "../web_modules/react.js";
import ReactDOM from "../web_modules/react-dom.js";
ReactDOM.render(
  /* @__PURE__ */ React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, world!"),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

## Create a first component <a id="create-a-first-component" />

[&#9650;](#introduction-to-react)

- `React` development is based on **`components`**. These **self-contained** units are designed for **reuse** and **modularity**. `React` projects typically contain many components.

- A **`component`** can be either a `function` or a `class`. Most React developers prefer to create **`components`** by using `functions`, so we'll focus on this style.

Applications generally have one **`core component`**, commonly called an **`App`**. The **`App`** acts as the **root** of the application.

## Create the component <a id="create-the-component" />

[&#9650;](#introduction-to-react)

Open Visual Studio Code. Create a new file in src. Name it **`App.jsx`** with the following code:

```js
import React from "react";

function App() {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>Recipe Manager</h1>
    </article>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- We start the **App.jsx** file by importing `React` so we can use `JSX syntax`.
- We then create a `function` named **`App`**, like we would create any other `function` in `JavaScript`.
- Finally, we export the `function` by using the standard `JavaScript` syntax. The **core** of our **`component`** is contained in the **`return`** statement.
- Notice that we're using `HTML` (technically `XML`) embedded in `JavaScript`. This functionality shows the power of `JSX`. We can use the logic and power of JavaScript to create **self-contained** units of work (`components`).
- The `HTML` returned by the `function` (or `component`) is displayed on the page. The `heading` contains the text **Recipe Manager**.
- The **`h1`** element nests inside an HTML 5 article element. Because `JSX` uses `XML`, we must have one **`root element`**. The **`article`** element is the **`root`** for this `component`. This structure allows us to add `HTML` and other `React` components as our application grows.

## Using the core component <a id="using-the-core-component" />

[&#9650;](#introduction-to-react)

Let's update our application to use our new component in **`index.jsx`**

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

## Display dynamic data <a id="display-dynamic-data" />

[&#9650;](#introduction-to-react)

To display **dynamic data** inside a `component`, use the syntax **`{ }`**, sometimes called **`handlebars`**. This style of syntax is relatively common in `HTML` templating tools. Use these **`handlebars`** to effectively switch to `JavaScript` mode and run almost any valid `JavaScript`.

For example, to display the **current time**, you could use the following code:

```js
<div>{Date.now()}</div>
```

In the previous example, we'll create a `component` for the **`title of a recipe`**. We'll use a `JavaScript` variable for the title to show how `React` can **display dynamic data**. Future units will show you how to work with more complex data.

- Create a new file in the src folder. Name it **`RecipeTitle.jsx`**. Add the following code to **`RecipeTitle.jsx`**:

```js
import React from "react";

function RecipeTitle() {
  const title = "Mashed potatoes";
  return <h2>{title}</h2>;
}
export default RecipeTitle;
```

Update the **`App.jsx`** as follows to include the Dynamic Component.

```js
import React from "react";
import RecipeTitle from "./RecipeTitle";

function App() {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>Recipe Manager</h1>
      <RecipeTitle />
    </article>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Add Style <a id="add-style" />

[&#9650;](#introduction-to-react)

Ass a new **`style.css`** file as follows:

```css
article {
  margin-left: 10%;
  margin-right: 10%;
  font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;
  font-size: 18px;
}
```

Update the **`App.jsx`** to import the **`style.css`** as follows:

```js
import "./index.css";
```

<br />
<br />
<br />
