## Importing libraries <a id="importing-libraries" />

[&#9650;](#access-external-libraries-from-typescript)

- In JavaScript, you use external libraries in your code by using the **`requires`** statement.
- In TypeScript, you gain access to them by using the **`import`** statement.
- After importing a library and its type definition, you can use it in your code and gain the benefits of **Intellisense and type checking**.

## Type libraries <a id="type-libraries" />

[&#9650;](#access-external-libraries-from-typescript)

- Static typing is a primary reason to use TypeScript. External type libraries are available for almost all common libraries providing this information for libraries that don't contain it (such as those written in JavaScript).
- The TypeScript compiler can raise an error message if you attempt to use a library that doesn't have type definitions. Youâ€™ll also notice that Intellisense is not available when you lack these definitions.
- While some JavaScript libraries will have type definitions, you will discover many do not. The open-source project **DefinitelyTyped** is a repository of TypeScript type definitions for many popular JavaScript libraries. You install type definitions by using the **`@types`** prefix.
- Because the type definitions are only used by TypeScript during **design-time**, they are not required to be part of the **published project**. As a result, you can install them as devDependencies.

```text
npm install --save-dev @types/<library-name>
```

## Exercise: install and implement type library "dotenv" <a id="exercise-install-and-implement-type-library-dotenv" />

[&#9650;](#access-external-libraries-from-typescript)

1 . Add a new file **`Main.ts`**

2 . From the terminal (on the exercise folder), generate a new **`tsconfig.json`** file with default configuration settings.

```text
tsc --init
```

3 . Go to [DefinitelyTyped](https://www.definitelytyped.org/) => webseo1 **(ambigous step??)**

4 . use npm to install the dotenv type library in your project folder.

```text
npm install dotenv
```

5 . Create a new file in the root directory of your project called **`.env`**. This file will contain environment-specific variables for the project

6 . In **`.env`**, add the variables on new lines in the form of NAME=VALUE. For this example, define three variables:

```text
DB_HOST=localhost
WEB_HOST=staging.adventure-works.com
```

7 . In Main.ts, import the dotenv type library.

```ts
import dotenv from "dotenv";
```

8 . Assign `dotenv.config()` to a variable. `config` reads your `.env` file, parses the contents, assigns it to **`process.env`**, and returns an object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.

```ts
const result = dotenv.config();
```

9 . TypeScript can now provide Intellisense and type checking for the config object. If you type **`result.`**, you see that result has two properties: `error` and `parsed`.

10 . Add an error checking statement to verify that the config operation worked as expect.

```ts
if (result.error) {
  throw result.error;
}
```

11 . Return the contents of the **`parsed`** property to the console.

```ts
console.log(result.parsed); // Returns { DB_HOST: 'localhost', WEB_HOST: 'staging.adventure-works.com' }
```

12 . Access the values contains in each key in **`process.env`** and return the value to the console.

```ts
console.log(process.env.DB_HOST);
console.log(process.env.WEB_HOST);
```

## Exercise: Export and import module components (Loan Calculation) <a id="exercise-export-and-import-module-components-loan-calculation" />

**`loans.ts`**

```ts
export interface Loan {
  principle: number;
  interestRate: number; //* Interest rate percentage (eg. 14 is 14%)
}
export interface ConventionalLoan extends Loan {
  months: number; //* Total number of months
}
```

**`loan-programs.ts`**

```ts
import * as Loans from "./loans.js";

export function calculateInterestOnlyLoanPayment(
  loanTerms: Loans.Loan
): string {
  let payment: number;
  payment = loanTerms.principle * calculateInterestRate(loanTerms.interestRate);
  return "The interest only loan payment is " + payment.toFixed(2);
}

export function calculateConventionalLoanPayment(
  loanTerms: Loans.ConventionalLoan
): string {
  let interest: number = calculateInterestRate(loanTerms.interestRate);
  let payment: number;
  payment =
    (loanTerms.principle * interest) /
    (1 - Math.pow(1 / (1 + interest), loanTerms.months));
  return "The conventional loan payment is " + payment.toFixed(2);
}

function calculateInterestRate(interestRate: number): number {
  let interest: number = interestRate / 1200;
  return interest;
}
```

**`main.ts`**

```ts
import * as LoanPrograms from "./loan-programs.js";

let interestOnlyPayment = LoanPrograms.calculateInterestOnlyLoanPayment({
  principle: 30000,
  interestRate: 5,
});
let conventionalLoanPayment = LoanPrograms.calculateConventionalLoanPayment({
  principle: 30000,
  interestRate: 5,
  months: 180,
});
console.log(interestOnlyPayment); //* Returns "The interest only loan payment is 125.00"
console.log(conventionalLoanPayment); //* Returns "The conventional loan payment is 237.24"
```
