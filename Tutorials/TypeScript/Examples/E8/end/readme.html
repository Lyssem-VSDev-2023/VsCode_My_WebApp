<h2>Using the Lab start and end solution files</h2>
<p>You can use the TypeScript <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play">Playground</a>, Visual Studio Code, or any TypeScript-compatible IDE to complete the labs in the &quot;Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript&quot; [LINK TO the Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript] learning path.</p>
<p>The <strong>start</strong> and <strong>end</strong> solutions for each lab are located in the <strong>code</strong> folder. In each lab, you will be provided with a link to each folder, as appropriate, for easy access.</p>
<h3>Setup Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>If you want to use Visual Studio Code to run any of the <strong>start</strong> or <strong>end</strong> solution workspaces in the <strong>code</strong> folder, you must first set up your development environment.</p>
<p>Install the following software on your machine:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visual Studio Code (or IDE of your choice)</li>
<li>Node Package Manager (npm)</li>
<li>TypeScript Compiler (tsc)</li>
</ol>
<p>For best results, follow the complete instructions for setting up your environment and using the TypeScript compiler in [LINK TO Module 01: Get started with TypeScript ]. After setting up your environment, you can run any of the Lab solution files in the &quot;Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript&quot; [LINK TO the Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript] learning path.</p>
<h3>Playground</h3>
<p>If youâ€™re using the Playground, you can copy and paste the start code from the Lab instructions into the editor. The solution to the lab exercises will be located in the <strong>end</strong> folder in the <strong>module##.ts</strong> file, which you can open in any text editor.</p>
